\begin{abstract}

We present the SIMPLE Archive alongside its database management tool, AstrodbKit2. SIMPLE is an archive of low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets driven by community curation and review using GitHub. SIMPLE relies on AstrodbKit2 to convert back and forth from a document-store model of the database, to a more standard relational database that can be used with established packages like SQLAlchemy. In this poster, we present the architecture of the SIMPLE database and how using AstrodbKit2 facilitates a git workflow for reviewing and approving database modifications.

SIMPLE is available at https://github.com/SIMPLE-AstroDB/SIMPLE-db 

AstrodbKit2 is available at https://github.com/dr-rodriguez/AstrodbKit2
